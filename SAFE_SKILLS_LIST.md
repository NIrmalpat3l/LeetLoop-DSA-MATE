## ‚ö†Ô∏è Skills to Avoid Unless You Have Proof

### Don't Add These Unless You've Actually Implemented Them:
```
‚ùå Docker (unless you've containerized your app)
‚ùå Kubernetes (unless you've used it)
‚ùå AWS Services (unless you've deployed there)
‚ùå Unit Testing (unless you have test files)
‚ùå Integration Testing (unless you have test suites)
‚ùå Redis (unless you've used caching)
‚ùå MongoDB (you're using PostgreSQL)
‚ùå GraphQL Server (you consume GraphQL, don't serve it)
‚ùå Microservices (this is a monolithic Next.js app)
‚ùå Machine Learning Models (you use pre-trained LLMs)
‚ùå Data Science Libraries (unless you've used them)
‚ùå Mobile Development (unless you've built mobile apps)
```

## üìã How to Present Skills Honestly

### Instead of saying:
‚ùå "Expert in Docker and Kubernetes"
‚ùå "Advanced Machine Learning Engineer"
‚ùå "Microservices Architecture Specialist"

### Say this:
‚úÖ "Full-stack developer with Next.js and React"
‚úÖ "Experience with AI API integration (Groq LLM)"
‚úÖ "Built responsive web applications with modern tech stack"
‚úÖ "Integrated third-party APIs and authentication systems"
‚úÖ "Developed data visualization and dashboard interfaces"

---

## üí° Tips for Skill Presentation

### 1. Use Project Context
```
‚úÖ "Built a spaced repetition system using React and TypeScript"
‚úÖ "Implemented OAuth authentication with Supabase"
‚úÖ "Created interactive data visualizations with Recharts"
```

### 2. Focus on What You Actually Built
```
‚úÖ "Developed AI-powered problem categorization feature"
‚úÖ "Designed responsive calendar interface with category icons"
‚úÖ "Built real-time dashboard with progress tracking"
```

### 3. Mention Learning & Growth
```
‚úÖ "Learned and implemented spaced repetition algorithms"
‚úÖ "Gained experience with modern authentication patterns"
‚úÖ "Developed skills in AI API integration"
```
